	<h2>Ronda:</h2>
	<p>There will always be 3 more black cards in the right pile than there are red cards in the left pile.</p>

	<h2>Rope Game:</h2>
	<p>He can divide the land into 16 plots. The first string divides the circle in half. The second divides it into four. The third rope crosses the first two and divides the land into seven plots. Once all the ropes have been placed, the man has 16 plots at his disposal.</p>

	<h2>An english woman in NY:</h2>
	<p>The plane arrives in Los Angeles at 2 p.m. With the three-hour time difference, it is 3 p.m. in New York when it is noon in Los Angeles. The plane arrives in New York at 8 p.m., so the outbound flight took five hours. The return flight to Los Angeles also lasts five hours, which means that the plane lands at 5 p.m. New York time. Taking into account the time difference, it can be concluded that the plane arrives in Los Angeles at 14:00.<p>

	<h2>Some quick maths:</h2>
	<p>You have to guess how long a mathematician has been around based on his or her statements, which you can turn into an equation. The x value corresponds to the mathematician's lifetime. With the first sentence, we deduce that x/6 + x/12 + x/7. Then 5 + x/2 + 4. The equation gives: x = x (1/6 + 1/12 + 1/7 + 1/2) + 5 + 4. With a common denominator: x = x (14/84 + 7/84 + 12/84 + 42/84) + 9. We then see that x = x (75/84) + 9 = 75x/84 + 9. x - 75x/84 = 9. Then, by reducing we have 9x/84 = 9 so x = 84.
So the man died at 84.</p>

	<h2>Will you take some maths again ?:</h2>
	<p>The equation is perfectly correct if A has a value of 8, B has a value of 7, and C has a value of 4. At first glance, the number of possibilities may make you think this puzzle is very difficult, but once you understand that only a few numbers can replace A, everything becomes clear. The answer is 88 x 88 = 7744! <p>

	<h2>A commercial magician:</h2>
	<p>The answer is 211 beads. The number of beads the traveller brought back (minus one) is a whole number between 1 and 500, divisible by 2,3,5,6 and 7. To find this number, list the multiples of 7 less than 500 and divide them by other numbers. Any number divisible by 6 is also divisible by 2 and 3, so just find a number divisible by 6 and 5. This leaves only 210, and you only need to add one to find the answer. The magician, on the other hand, is waiting for 421 beads.  <p>

	<h2>A mysterious number:</h2>
	<p>The question mark should be replaced by the number 89! In fact, you have to find the square of each of the digits of a number and then add them together. This will give you the next number in the sequence.<p>
